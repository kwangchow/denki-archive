There are many ways to interpret these targets and measurements (and sometimes they clash and need balancing) but what follows are some pertinent points.

## The End
*The End is thinking like a player. The End is everything.*

* Feel
* Drama
* Alive
* Convenient
* Twist

### Feel
* Sensory and emotional stimulus.
* This is a tactile medium.
* It feels tangible, reactive, plausible, solid, real.
* It feels good and makes you feel good.
* A remarkable experience.
* It feels fair.
* Fluid.
* Good value.
* It makes you smile.
* You feel moved, involved, empowered.
* You feel like you make the difference.
* You feel just out of control but just enough in control.
* You feel like there's no one to blame but yourself.

### Drama
* Make a show – a performance.
* Arrangements of moments you want to share.
* Distinctive. Not samey.
* Dramatic intentions, actions, interactions and reactions.
* Dramatic settings.
* Anticipation, friction, close shaves, exaggeration and spectacle.
* Punctuation through considered rhythm, pace and timing.
* Dramatic player 'journeys' – growth.
* Make stories not follow them.
* As exciting to watch as it is to play.
* Think performance. The player is a performer. The toys are performers. The product is a
performer. We are performers. All for the player's personal pleasure.

### Alive
* Personal.
* A living, breathing joy with a character.
* A game with heart and soul.
* Never dead.
* Attentive. Informative. Considerate.
* No nasty surprises.
* Interactive.
* Atmospheric.
* Playful.
* Stylish.
* Evolving.
* Reactive to the real world and events.

### Convenient
* Accessible. Immediate. Simple. Succinct.
* Easy replay.
* Directed. You don't have to make your own entertainment.
* Chores removed, automated or dramatised.
* No waiting. No obstacles between players and play.
* Get it or be inspired to get it NOW. Get into it NOW. Get satisfaction in less than 60 seconds.
* But never too convenient to win because that tends to mean too easy and too boring.

### Twist
* A twist in the idea and/or the execution.
* A meaningful difference in the concept, the components, the treatment, the look, sound
feel...
* Surprise and delight.

## The Way
*The Way is thinking like a maker and represents the Means to The End.* 

* Immediate
* Preparation 
* Toys
* Magic
* Moments

### Immediate
* Prove it. Make it here and now and in any form. Play-act. Sketch. Prototype. Make something to use and edit.
* Visibility to all.
* Don't aim for perfect first time.
* Frequent, measured, tangible iteration.
* Efficiency.
* Kill complexity and bottlenecks.
* Clear accountability.
* Think (and use) repertoire. Aim to use what's proven, known and familiar.
* Use thorough reference. From any source. Learn from others. Make our own reference: prototype, visualise, audiolise...
* Test (play) often, in isolation and context.
* Development is quicksand. Don't stand too still for too long. Keep moving.
* No convoluted process.
* Balance with Preparation.

### Preparation
* Chance favours the prepared mind.
* Expect trouble. Prepare to fail.
* Practice makes perfect. Rehearse. Explore. Get a sense of perspective.
* Do to build repertoire, like musicians, actors and chefs.
* Repertoire is applied muscle: the practised, reusable and extendable.
* Use iteration paths.
* Easy to edit. It's easier to change something than to make it in the first place. It's easier to
see how to change something that exists.
* Maximise editing power and time. It's all in the edit.
* Balance with Immediate.

### Toys
* The tools of play. Honed for fun.
* Toys mean play and play means fun. Not play is sleep or work.
* By thinking toys you think playful, you think fun, you think suitably simplified.
* Think toy sets and toy components not pixels and polygons.

### Magic
* Make illusions not simulations.
* Don't limit yourself to recreating reality.
* High tolerance.
* Minimise complication.
* Start with the end in sight then figure out how best to get there.
* Fake it to make the virtual appear real.
* Keep it consistent to make it plausible.
* Keep the workings invisible.
* Cohesion. Consider the whole and the parts. The big picture. The experience. The overall
effect.
* What to leave in. What to leave out.

### Moments
* Think dramatic moments.
* Define memorable moments and use them as design targets and building blocks.
* Consider how best to make, chain, pace and acknowledge moments such as repetition,
concurrence, coincidence, extremes, firsts, winning, just losing, the start and the end.
* Timing.
* Consider every action, activity and challenge.
* Use emotionally stimulating reference material.
